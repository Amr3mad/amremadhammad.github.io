            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I'm a recent graduate mechatronics engineer from Nile University. I have had many Part-Time job experiences in marketing, teaching, exam invigilation, and events organizing. All these job experiences I consider as extracurricular activities, as it has molded 90% of the available soft skills I have. I'm a science-passionate nerd who has an interest in all science tracks, and that's not a lucky hit I guess. I'm interested in research and development, a sustainable earth vision with reinforces the importance of recycling the available resources. I chose the mechatronics track as it's the only track that fulfills my science and engineering learning passion. I consider my track a special one with the availability of daily updates and industry enhancements with the merging of all engineering and information technology tracks in one track to follow up and produce personnel able to utilize, improve, and design modern industry tech. I would never consider myself as a mechanical engineer only, or an electrical engineer, or even a computer engineer, but rather consider myself the mechatronics engineer who has a solid education about those disciplines and is further enhanced with much more managerial and computational soft skills.</p>
